# firefly

A digitial implementation of this demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix66tQ93bdU

Click and drag the fireflies to move them. The firefly will turn pink if it can see another firefly. Click the pink/white button on each firefly to make it blink immediately, resetting the blink pattern.
